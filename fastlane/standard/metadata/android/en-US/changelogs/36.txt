New in 1.5.0-beta
★ Only accept JPEG images.
★ Fix some empty EXIF tags showing:
  - Re-write scrambling code (grabbed it from ExifDataRemover - thank you so much, NightlyNexus!)
  - Remove 'force re-write option' (it was still adding empty tags)
  - The 'Keep orientation' option now re-writes the image rotating it "physically" (to avoid adding empty tags).
★ Remove img_eggsif prefix from 'rename images' option:
  - Use a standard UUID for the filename instead.
