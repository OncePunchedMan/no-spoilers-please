This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Scrambled Exif for mobile devices that was created by juanitobananas (Juan Garc√≠a Basilio).

## Data collected by me

I, that is, the app developer, do not collect any personal information whatsoever.

## Data collected by Google Play (only applies if downloaded from Google Play Store)

Google Inc. provides the developer, i.e. me, with anonymised user data (aggregate data) through the Google Play Developer Console.

If you review the app Google Inc. will additionally provide information about your device (Device, Manufacturer, Device type, Device language, CPU make, CPU model, Native platform, RAM (MB), Screen size, Screen density (dpi), OpenGL ES version and OS).

Please refer to the [Google Play Store Privacy Policy](https://play.google.com/about/privacy-security/) for more information on how Google Inc. handles your data.

## Data collected by F-Droid (only applies if downloaded from F-Droid)

As far as I know, F-Droid Limited does not collect any personal information whatsoever.

Please refer to the [F-Droid web page](https://f-droid.org/about/) for more information.

## Email communication

If you contact me per email, I will exclusively use your contact data to process your inquiry.

Please feel free to contact me, e.g. per email ([juam+scrambled@posteo.net](mailto:juam+scrambled@posteo.net)), if you want me to delete your data.

## Crash reporting tool (ACRA)

This app uses an open-source crash reporting library called [ACRA](https://www.acra.ch/).

If the app crashes, ACRA collects information about the crash with lots of context data (please refer to [this page from the ACRA wiki](https://github.com/ACRA/acra/wiki/ReportContent) for details on the info that ACRA collects). This information is stored temporarily on your device and won't leave your device unnoticed. It then shows you a notification which allows you to send me this (very detailed) report. If you tap on the *Send email* button in the notification, it will simply redirect you to your favorite email app with a ready-to-send email which you can inspect if you wish before finally sending.

None of this data is automatically sent to any server. Ever.

If you decide to send the crash report, I will exclusively use the information you send me to help fix the issue that caused the crash.

Please feel free to contact me, e.g. per email ([juam+scrambled@posteo.net](mailto:juam+scrambled@posteo.net)), if you want me to delete your data.
